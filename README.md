# freightr

**freightr** is a small application that makes it easy for anybody who ships, receives, transports, or facilitates the transport of goods to manage their freight-related processes.
It was conceived of as a demo access to show what might be a good, simple use case for Microsoft Access.
The entire project is MIT-licensed, so anyone who wishes can make full use of the database, documentation, or underlying data model for whatever purpose suits them.

Check out the [usage guide](doc/usage/overview.md) for details on the application.
