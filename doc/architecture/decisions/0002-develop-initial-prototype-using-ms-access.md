# 2. Develop Initial Prototype Using MS Access

Date: 2023-03-10

## Status

Accepted

## Context

I don't really have any idea whether there's a market for this applicaiton.
Also, I'm building it mostly as a skills demo project specifically for Access and access-related work I'd like to offer.
It's also worth noting that Access, while very dated and suitable only for the most basic use cases, does in fact have some useful features.
What's more, it has a significant mindshare among SMBs and department-level management.

## Decision

The initial prototype for freightr will be a Microsoft Access database.

## Consequences

The biggest negative consequence is that the code and design artifacts won't be effectively version-controlled.
The primary positive consequence is simply the presence of a prototype tool that I can use as a skills demo.
Another positive consequence is that someone in the business or tech community may actually find this small application useful, at least as a starting point.
